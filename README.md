# Rivals Assets

Welcome to my repository of all images I could gather for Command & Conquer: Rivals!

Within this repo you'll find images of:

* All unit and commander cards, as seen in-game
* All units and commanders with a background, as seen on the official website
* All units and commanders with a transparent background
* All units *cropped* with a transparent background
* A high-rez version of all the maps in the game
* All the in-game fonts
* A zip file with everything for easy downloading

And much more! Have a gander at everything. Feel free to clone the repo, download it, or do whatever you need.

## Fan Project

This repo is a fan project and I have no connection to EA or Redwood Studios. I am just a content creator who didn't have everything when I started out, so I decided to assemble everything I had to share for all who want to use it!

## Transparent vs. Transparent Cropped

The transparent images are those found with the backgrounds, just with the background stripped out. Therefore, they are larger than just the unit image. The cropped images are just the unit, making it easier to align in your design software of choice.
